The next 2 screens are where you can load and resize your images into the template area to add your custom launch page background image and the start button.. the start button can be moved into 1 of 3 positions, or by pressing START it will use the background image giving it the illusion of being transparent.. from the button page you also have the ability of adding manual images (optional)
